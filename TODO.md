# TODO

A minimal list of next steps for this repository.

- Review folder structure for clarity
- Expand theme tokens in `themes.css`
- Add more scaffolding patterns in `scaffolding.css`
- Add common utility transitions in `transitions.css`
- Add small example components (CSS-only)
- Create optional demo page showing UI states

This list stays intentionally small to avoid noise.
